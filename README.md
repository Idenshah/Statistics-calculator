<h1>Static Calculator</h1>

Static Calculator is a simple web application built with ASP.NET Razor Pages that allows you to perform basic calculations on a set of numbers.
You can easily calculate the minimum, maximum, average, and total of the numbers you input.
This tool is designed to be user-friendly and provides real-time validation to ensure accurate calculations.

<h4>Features</h4>

Input Validation: Static Calculator ensures that you enter only numbers in the input fields.
If you attempt to input anything other than numbers, a validation error will appear next to the corresponding input box.

Minimum Number Requirement: You must enter a minimum of two numbers in the input fields to perform calculations.
If you try to calculate without meeting this requirement, an error message will remind you to enter at least two numbers.

Calculations: Once you've entered at least two valid numbers, the calculation box will appear, allowing you to calculate the minimum, maximum, average, and total of the entered numbers.
